## Hey, I’m Weslley 👋

Frontend Senior Engineer focused on **architecture, performance, and developer experience**.

I spend less time shipping components and more time helping teams make **good decisions that age well**.

---

**What I usually work on**
- Frontend architecture for long-lived products
- Design systems and cross-team consistency
- Performance, accessibility, and reliability
- Incremental refactors in production systems

**How I think**
- Optimize for change, not cleverness
- Boring abstractions > fragile ones
- DX is a feature
- Strong opinions, loosely held

**Tools I use**
- React, TypeScript, React Native  
- Storybook, design systems  
- Node, tRPC, Graphql,

If you care about building frontends that don’t rot under their own weight, we’ll probably get along.
